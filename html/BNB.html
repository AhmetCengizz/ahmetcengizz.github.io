        <h1>What Is Binance Coin (BNB)?</h1>
        <p> Launched in July 2017, Binance is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange globally based on daily trading
            volume.
            Binance aims to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea
            behind
            Binance’s name is to show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance.

            Aside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of
            functionalities for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, Binance
            Academy, Trust Wallet and Research projects, which all employ the powers of blockchain technology to bring
            new-age finance to the world. Binance Coin is an integral part of the successful functioning of many of the
            Binance sub-projects.</p>

        <h1>Who Are the Founders of Binance Coin?</h1>
        <p>Changpeng Zhao is the founder and CEO of Binance. In 2001, Zhao joined Bloomberg as head of tradebook futures
            development. He spent four years with the company and later joined Fusion Systems as a partner.

            Since 2013, Changpeng Zhao has been actively involved with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He
            became
            head of development at Blockchain, and in 2015 he founded BijieTech. In 2017, Zhao officially launched
            Binance,
            and he has been the CEO of the company ever since.

            He Yi is a co-founder and chief marketing officer at Binance. She started her career as a TV anchor and
            presenter on China Travel TV in 2012. Later, in 2014, Yi co-founded OKCoin, which was the largest
            fiat-to-crypto
            exchange in China at the time. In 2017, she joined forces with Changpeng Zhao, and together they created the
            largest crypto exchange globally — Binance.</p>

        <h1>What Makes Binance Coin Unique?</h1>
        <p>Binance is a unique ecosystem of decentralized, blockchain-based networks. The company has grown to be the
            leading crypto exchange in a number of countries, and their side organizations are attracting significant
            interest as well.

            One of the biggest competitive advantages Binance has is its drive for development. While the company
            started
            only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different
            spheres.
            According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the
            entire
            blockchain ecosystem.

            Since launching the Binance Coin, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the
            token.
            BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of
            enterprise investors.</p>

        <h1>How Many Binance Coin (BNB) Coins Are There in Circulation?</h1>
        <p>There is an initial maximum supply of 200,000,000 BNB coins, of which 168,137,036 are currently in
            circulation
            as of September 2021.

            Binance conducts quarterly burning of the Binance Coin supply, with the goal of reducing the total supply by
            half — or 100,000,000 BNB. On July 18, 2021, it conducted its 16th quarterly burning, which was worth $390
            million in Binance Coin price at the time of burning. However, that was not the most expensive burn — on
            April
            16, 2021, the exchange burned nearly $600 million worth, in Binance Coin price at the time of burning.

            According to the Binance whitepaper, exactly half of the maximum supply of BNB tokens was allocated towards
            the
            initial coin offering (ICO) and public sale of the token. The ICO was held in July 2017 shortly after the
            exchange launched, and saw Binance raise $15 million in funding, with Binance Coin price at $0.10 during the
            ICO. Taking Binance Coin price today, that represents an almost 4200X return on investment (ROI). Another
            40% of
            the total supply, or around 80,000,000 BNB coins, was distributed among the founding members and team.
            Finally,
            the remaining 10% of the maximum supply was split among angel investors</p>

        <h1>How Is the Binance Coin Network Secured?</h1>
        <p> Initially, the Binance coin started as a traditional ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Later on, the
            company introduced its own blockchain, and the coins started being issued from the Binance blockchain,
            secured
            by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism.

            While ERC-20 tokens rely on the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, which allows them to be extremely scalable,
            and
            allows for the creation of smart contracts. Unlike PoS, the Binance blockchain does not support smart
            contract
            functionalities. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, which
            is
            far more limited and consumes large amounts of electrical and computing power.</p>

        <h1>Where Can You Buy Binance Coin (BNB)?</h1>
        <p> As the dedicated utility token of the Binance exchange, the most straightforward way to acquire BNB coins
            would
            be to purchase them through Binance. The original exchange supports the largest variety of trading pairs
            with
            BNB, and it also has the best trading rates for the coin. Since the launch of Play2Earn games, interest in
            the
            BNB to PHP price has increased substantially.

            If you are looking for alternative exchanges where you can purchase BNB, FTX is a good choice. Keep in mind
            that
            investing in cryptocurrency can be risky, just like investing in any other type of asset.

            To check Binance Coin price live in the fiat currency of your choice, you can use CoinMarketCap’s converter
            feature directly on the Binance Coin currency page. Alternatively, use the dedicated exchange rate converter
            page. Popular Binance Coin price pairs include: BNB/USD, BNB/GBP, BNB/AUD, BNB/CNY, BNB/JPY and BNB/EUR.</p>
