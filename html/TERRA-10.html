        What Is Terra (LUNA)?
        </h1>

        <p>
            Terra is a blockchain protocol that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to power price-stable global payments systems. According to 
        its white paper, Terra combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of 
        Bitcoin (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements. Development on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially
         launched in April 2019. As of September 2021, it offers stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik
          and the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options.
           Terra's native token, LUNA, is used to stabilize the price of the protocol's stablecoins. LUNA holders are also able to submit and
            vote on governance proposals, giving it the functionality of a governance token.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Are the Founders of Terra?</h2>
        <p>
            Terra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two conceived of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption 
        of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of 
        Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra. Prior to developing Terra, Shin co-founded and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as 
        TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later co-founded Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs 
        to build fully functional companies. Kwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless
         mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple.

<h2>What Makes Terra Unique?</h2>
<p>
    Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of 
    cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that 
    automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins 
    at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand. Terra has established a
     number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra announced a partnership with
      Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are
       processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant.
</p>
<h2>How Is the Terra Network Secured?</h2>
<p>
    The Terra blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm based on Tendermint, in which LUNA token holders stake their
     tokens as collateral to validate transactions, receiving rewards in proportion to the amount of LUNA staked. Tokenholders may also
      delegate others to validate transactions on their behalf, sharing in any revenue generated. Terra also offers additional guidance to
       validator nodes on the best practices for helping to keep the network secure. In May 2019, shortly after Terra's mainnet went live,
        blockchain verification and penetration testing firm CertiK completed a security audit of the network. It examined its economic model
         to test against market manipulation, its architecture and its coding language. CertiK found that the "modeling and mathematical
          reasoning" of the Terra network were "considered sound," although it would not comment on the blockchain's performance.
