        <h1>What Is Tether (USDT)?</h1>

        <p> USDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a
            Hong
            Kong-based company Tether. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of commercial paper,
            fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills in reserves that is equal in USD value to
            the
            number of USDT in circulation.

            Originally launched in July 2014 as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin’s
            blockchain through the use of the Omni platform, it was later renamed to USTether, and then, finally, to
            USDT.
            In addition to Bitcoin’s, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG
            blockchains.

            The stated purpose of USDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies — which can be sent
            between
            users without a trusted third-party intermediary — with the stable value of the US dollar</p>

        <h1>Who Are The Founders Of Tether?</h1>
        <p>USDT — or as it was known at the time, Realcoin — was launched in 2014 by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins and
            Craig
            Sellars.

            Brock Pierce is a well-known entrepreneur who has co-founded a number of high-profile projects in the crypto
            and
            entertainment industries. In 2013, he co-founded a venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, which by 2017
            had
            raised over $80 million in funding. In 2014, Pierce became the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a
            nonprofit
            established to help improve and promote Bitcoin. Pierce has also co-founded Block.one, the company behind
            EOS,
            one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market.

            Reeve Collins was the CEO of Tether for the first two years of its existence. Prior to that, he had
            co-founded
            several successful companies, such as the online ad network Traffic Marketplace, entertainment studio
            RedLever
            and gambling website Pala Interactive. As of 2020, Collins is heading SmarMedia Technologies, a marketing
            and
            advertising tech company.

            Other than working on Tether, Craig Sellars has been a member of the Omni Foundation for over six years. Its
            Omni Protocol allows users to create and trade smart-contract based properties and currencies on top of
            Bitcoin’s blockchain. Sellars has also worked in several other cryptocurrency companies and organizations,
            such
            as Bitfinex, Factom, Synereo and the MaidSafe Foundation.
        </p>
        <h1>What Makes Tether Unique?</h1>
        <p>USDT’s unique feature is the fact that its value is guaranteed by Tether to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar.
            According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its
            reserves,
            thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents.

            The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20%
            within
            a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these
            fluctuations.

            This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park
            their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a
            simple
            way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain —
            without
            having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider.

            However, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims
            about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in
            its
            history. Many have raised concerns about the fact that Tether’s reserves have never been fully audited by an
            independent third party.</p>

        <h1>How Many Tether (USDT) Coins Are There In Circulation?</h1>
        <p>There is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of USDT — given the fact that it belongs to a private
            company,
            theoretically, its issuance is limited only by Tether’s own policies. However, because Tether claims that
            every
            single USDT is supposed to be backed by one U.S. dollar, the amount of tokens is limited by the company’s
            actual
            cash reserves.

            Moreover, Tether does not disclose its issuance schedules ahead of time. Instead, they provide daily
            transparency reports, listing the total amount of their asset reserves and liabilities, the latter
            corresponding
            to the amount of USDT in circulation.

            As of September 2020, there are over 14.4 billion USDT tokens in circulation, which are backed by $14.6
            billion
            in assets, according to Tether.</p>

        <h1>How Is the Tether Network Secured?</h1>
        <p>USDT does not have its own blockchain — instead, it operates as a second-layer token on top of other
            cryptocurrencies’ blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash and OMG, and is secured
            by
            their respective hashing algorithms.</p>
