        <h1>What Is Bitcoin (BTC)?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of
            people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal,
            independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them.
            Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from
            one party to another without going through a financial institution.”</p>

        <p>Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the
            distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.</p>

        <h1>Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?</h1>
        Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the
        person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.

        <p>On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer,
            online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged
            in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be
            dubbed “blockchain.”</p>

        <p>Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as
            the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first
            introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices
            (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010,
            when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in
            mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as
            “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from
            $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.</p>

        <p>However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first
            implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who
            later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have
            contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.
        </p>

        <p>Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being
            Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.</p>

        <h1>What Makes Bitcoin Unique?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on
            the market.</p>

        <p>It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of
            enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives.
            The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently
            inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.</p>

        <p>The entire cryptocurrency market — now worth more than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by
            Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted
            intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.</p>

        <p>Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of
            existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest cryptocurrency, with
            a market capitalization that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after Bitcoin price hit an all-time
            high of $64,863.10 on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in
            Bitcoin, and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: wallets, exchanges, payment
            services, online games and more.</p>

        <h1>How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin’s total supply is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are
            created during the process known as “mining”: as transactions are relayed across the network, they get
            picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic
            calculations.</p>

        <p>As compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that
            they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per
            block: this number gets halved with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four
            years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders
            before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the
            competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate
            significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million
            Bitcoin.</p>

        <p>Mining Bitcoins can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of
            Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin
            on CoinMarketCap Alexandria — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to
            mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin. As of mid-September 2021, the Bitcoin mining reward is capped to
            6.25 BTC after the 2020 halving, which is roughly $299,200 in Bitcoin price today.</p>

        <h1>How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is secured with the SHA-256 algorithm, which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which
            is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as several other cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <h1>What Is Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value?</h1>
        Bitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that
        it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical
        asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto
        enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern
        financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.

        <p>The smallest units of Bitcoin, 0.00000001 BTC, are called Satoshis (or Sats in short), in a nod to the
            pseudonymous creator. At Bitcoin price now, 1 Satoshi is equivalent to roughly $0.00048.</p>

        <p>The top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the
            first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto
            and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a
            dollar — treating it as digital gold.</p>

        <h1>Crypto Wallets</h1>
        <p>The most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets vary
            from hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are able to be connected to the web, while cold wallets are
            used for keeping large amounts of coins outside of the internet.</p>

        <p>Some of the top crypto cold wallets are Trezor, Ledger and CoolBitX. Some of the top crypto hot wallets
            include Exodus, Electrum and Mycelium.</p>

        <p>Still not sure of which wallet to use? Check out CoinMarketCap Alexandria’s guide on the top cold wallets of
            2021 and top hot wallets of 2021.</p>

        <h1>How Is Bitcoin’s Technology Upgraded?</h1>
        <p>A hard fork is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and
            therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an
            incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to
            user C.</p>

        <p>A hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected
            to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs
            to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions
            from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions,
            although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.</p>

        <p>A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made
            invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This
            kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.</p>

        <p>Some examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following: Bitcoin’s hard
            fork that resulted in Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum’s hard fork that resulted in Ethereum Classic.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV. Read more
            about the difference between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV here.</p>

        <h1>What Is Taproot?</h1>
        <p>Taproot is a soft fork that bundles together BIP 340, 341 and 342 and aims to improve the scalability,
            efficiency, and privacy of the blockchain by introducing several new features.</p>

        <p>The two major changes are the introduction of the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST) and Schnorr
            Signature. MAST introduces a condition allowing the sender and recipient of a transaction to sign off on its
            settlement together. Schnorr Signature allows users to aggregate several signatures into one for a single
            transaction. This results in multi-signature transactions looking the same as regular transactions or more
            complex ones. By introducing this new address type, users can also save on transaction fees, as even complex
            transactions look like simple, single-signature ones.</p>

        <p>Although HODLers will probably not notice a big impact, Taproot could become a key milestone to equipping the
            network with smart contract functionality. In particular, Schnorr Signatures would lay the foundation for
            more complex applications to be built on top of the existing blockchain, as users start switching to Taproot
            addresses primarily. If adopted by users, Taproot could, in the long run, result in the network developing
            its own DeFi ecosystem that rivals those on alternative blockchains like Ethereum.</p>

        <h1>What Is the Lightning Network?</h1>
        <p>The Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels
            which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and
            trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without
            incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain.</p>

        <h1>How Much Is Bitcoin?</h1>
        <p>The current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a
            start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see
            above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how
            much Bitcoin is will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges
            show different prices and understanding how much Bitcoin is will be a function of a person’s location.</p>
